# Stampin' Up! - C# Coding Assessment

## Instructions:
1. Create a private fork of this repository on GitHub. Use of your personal account is not required but is preferred. 
2. Invite user "stampinup" as a collaborator
3. Create a branch off main named ```<yourusername>/<appropriate branch name>```
4. Add two projects
   - StampinUp.Api - ASP.NET Core Web API
   - Stampin.Api.Test - Unit Test Project
5. Add code to fulfill all requirements
6. Create a Pull Request into Main and assign user 'stampinup' as a reviewer 
7. Contact your HR representative via email when you feel you are done.

## Requirements:

- Create a Restful API using Asp.Net Dotnet 6.
- Your API must serve two different resources e.g. Lions and Bears, or Stamps and Ribbon. 
- Each resource must have an ID and at least 3 other reasonable properties of your choice.
- Each resource must have at least 1 endpoint
- The following HTTP Verbs must be demonstrated at least once in your project GET, PUT, POST, DELETE.
- Demonstrate persistence for each resource using EntityFramework or EntityFrameworkCore.
- Demonstrate appropriate usage of unit tests.
- Demonstrate appropriate usage of integration tests.
- Include a bare bones docker file
- Add any explanations, decision processes, or documentation you feel appropriate to the below section of this README.md. 
- DO NOT include any inappropriate items in your repository such as credentials or artifacts. 
- DO NOT use any cloud resources that you will have to pay for e.g. Azure SQL, AWS RDS.
 

## Hints:
 - Commit as if this was a work assignment. A regular and coherent git history is preferable to one single giant commit.
 - We will be looking for plaigarized code. Feel free to use online resources as necessary but do not submit a lightly adjusted version of a tutorial.
 - Feel free to ask questions by creating a Github task and assigning user "stampinup" and emailing your HR representative.
 - Break your project up into layers as you feel appropriate
 - Don't chase test coverage. We would rather see 50% coverage with good quality mutation resistent tests than 100% coverage with ineffective tests. 
 - You may use any other production-ready 3rd party libraries to ease your implementation, improve your tests, or help you deliver a more complete product.
 - We invite you to go beyond the requirements so that your submission stands out but keep it reasonable, spending more than a couple days on this is very likely overkill.
 - If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask us for direction. Collaboration is a critical part of the development process. 
 - There is no time limit nor recommended amount of time, within reason. A thorough and thoughtful submission that takes a day will be preferred over a 30 minute hastily thrown together submission.
